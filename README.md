Clean Simple Unobtrusive Table Tob RPG Manager

About:
There are many combat trackers, for many games, available across the internet.  However, many of these have unnecessary features that hinder rather than motivate the Role Playing process.  Combat in DnD can be tedious, and my goal is to remove that tedium with a tool that complements the GM rather than moving that tedium to a different place.  This program is initially for Pathfinder, but I intend to make this fluid and flexible, and usable for any RP system, especially Shadowrun.

What I actually want from it
   Easy Way to move character initiative positions around
   Easy way to add/remove monsters, summons, etc
   Add buffs/debuffs with Timed Duration

   Show various player stats
     HP/Max HP/ACs 

  Maybe?
    Will/Fort/Ref

Todo:
  If you get 4 monsters name it Gob1, Gob2, Gob3, Gob4
